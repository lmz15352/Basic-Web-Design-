        <P>In 480 B.C. a state of war exists between Persia, led by King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), and Greece. At the Battle of Thermopylae, Leonidas (Gerard Butler), king of the Greek city state of Sparta, leads his badly outnumbered warriors against the massive Persian army. Though certain death awaits the Spartans, their sacrifice inspires all of Greece to unite against their common enemy.</P>

        <h3>Random Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In the original script for 300, the line “This is Sparta!” wasn’t supposed to be yelled. In the comic book, it’s delivered in a stern but calm manner. Gerard Butler tried a few takes in which he delivered the line this way, but it didn’t have much of an impact.

                He tried one take in which he yelled the line at the top of his voice. Zack Snyder loved this delivery of the line and asked him to do it again. The second yelled take of “This is Sparta!!!” is the one that ended up in the movie.</li>
           
                <li>Since the script required all the male cast members to be ripped and shirtless in basically every scene, the actors were subjected to a grueling training regime for eight weeks before shooting. The regime was put together by Marc Twight, a record-breaking professional mountain climber. The actors never did the same exercise more than once to prevent their bodies from getting accustomed to certain types of exertion.</li>
            <li>300 is one of the bloodiest, goriest action movies of the 21st century. However, not an awful lot of fake blood was used during filming. In fact, the whole production only used about two gallons of fake blood. The rest was added digitally during the post-production phase.</li>
                
                <li>Although Frank Miller’s comic is as gory and graphic as the film based on it, Warner Bros. initially wanted their big-screen adaptation of the book to get a PG-13 rating. When Zack Snyder signed on, he wanted to make it R-rated, and Warner Bros. eventually relented.</li>
        </ul>
