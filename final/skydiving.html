        <p>Skydiving offers a variety of jump types to suit different levels of experience and thrill. Tandem jumps are perfect for beginners, where an instructor is harnessed to the jumper for a safe and guided experience. Solo jumps require more training and certification, allowing jumpers to experience the freedom of freefall on their own. Formation skydiving involves multiple jumpers creating patterns and formations in the sky. Wingsuit flying is an advanced form of skydiving where jumpers wear a special suit that allows them to glide through the air. Each type of jump offers a unique experience and a different perspective of the sky. Skydiving is not just about the jump; it's about the community, the preparation, and the unforgettable memories created with each leap.</p>
